# Password-Generator

This project is the creation of a random safe password generator where the user gets to select the length of their password as well as what kinds of characters they with to include in their password. This project focused on using javascript to creat logic that generates said password and displays it on screen.

I learned a lot about java during this project. I leraned prompt, confirm, and alert and I becamce confident using different kind of loops and confiditional statements inside of functions as I tested many different kinds of both as I came to this solution. I also got much more comforitable linking different functions together and understanding how to use thier inputs and outputs with local and global variables. also started to scrape the surface of using javascript to change what appears on the webpage itself.
